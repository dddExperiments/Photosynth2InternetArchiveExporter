                        The new Photosynth technology in this preview combines the tactile smoothness and extreme resolution of a stitched panorama
                        with the kind of motion through space that you see in video. It takes you on a smooth tour of a space while also allowing
                        you to "scrub" to any location smoothly, and it gives you access to every pixel from every photo.

                        In addition, to view the interactive synths, your system must support WebGL. To run WebGL, your system needs a modern
                        graphics card and processor. If WebGL is not supported on your system, we display a view-only movie version of the synth for you.
                        To check if your system can run WebGL, visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326145514/http://get.webgl.org/" target="_blank">http://get.webgl.org</a>.<br>
                        If you still can't view an interactive synth, your browser may be using compatibility mode to display it.
                        Check your browser's settings and disable compatibility mode for the page displaying the synth.

                        The Photosynth Technical Preview requires WebGL to views synths. Until now, very few phone browsers have supported WebGL. 
                        As this situation changes, we will be updating the synth viewer page to work on mobile devices. 
                        Until then, you may see an MP4 video instead of the fully interactive version of the synth.

                        A synth is a collection of overlapped photos together with the 3D information we've calculated about them.
                        In the original Photosynth technology (still available on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326145514/http://photosynth.net/">main site</a>),
                        the information was limited to the locations and orientation of the camera for each photo. In the new technology,
                        we are also modeling some of the 3D geometry revealed in the analysis. This geometry is what makes moving through
                        these new generation synths a lot smoother than the original ones.

                                Each point in the scene you are shooting must be present in at least three photos. Heavily overlap your shots.
                                This is the most important rule of thumb for using Photosynth.

                            <li>Take all your photos at the same zoom level. (Although, wide-angle photos usually make richer synths.)</li>
                            <li>Landscape mode works better than portrait mode, but stay in the same mode for a whole sequence.</li>
                            <li>Photos you upload should be at least 1.5 megapixels in resolution.</li>
                            <li>Do not crop or straighten your photos. Doing that confuses Photosynth.</li>
                            <li>Your photo sequence must form one of four simple shapes: a spin, panorama, wall, or walk.</li>

                        Select a point to keep roughly in the center of your frame for every shot. This point can be obvious and visible or one that
                        you visualize. Think of it as the center of gravity of your spin, and try to keep your camera pointing toward it in all shots.<br>
                        Shoot in landscape mode, and at a wide focal length. Shoot at least 20–30 photos, making sure to overlap your shots a lot.
                        If you are trying to capture something with many holes, shoot 40 or more photos as you move around the object to reduce 3D
                        artifacts.<br>
                        If you shoot all the way around an object, do not inadvertently spiral in or spiral out when completing the loop.
                        The easiest way to complete a clean loop is to put a marker on the ground where you shot the first frame, then make sure you
                        shoot the last frame from the exact same spot.<br>
                        <em>Turntable Shots:</em> The rule of thumb for turntables is to make anything that doesn't rotate disappear.
                        In practice, this means that any non-rotating background needs to be as featureless as possible.

                        Yes, but we do not support direct upload of video, so you will need to convert the video to still images and thin out or
                        reduce your frame rate before uploading. Video is usually shot at 30 frames per second. Since Photosynth usually needs no
                        more than one frame every half second, you should drop at least 14 out of every 15 frames. Also, frames from
                        video (even 1080p HD video) are very low resolution and noisy compared to almost any digital photo. So, while creating a synth
                        from a video sounds good, viewing one made from video isn't as appealing. As sensors continue to improve and video quality
                        gets better, this may change, but for now the results are almost always visually disappointing.

                        You can tweak color and contrast, but you should not apply any effects that add or subtract significant texture from the photos.
                        (Photosynth uses this texture when matching photos together.) Also, do not crop your photos. Cropping changes the fundamental geometry
                        of the photos as understood by Photosynth, and your results are likely to be poor. Do not apply sharpening, and be very careful about
                        any changes that you apply only to a portion of each image. In general, if you plan to touch up your photos, synth an unmodified
                        version first so you have a baseline for what to expect from Photosynth before you start to make modifications.

                <div class="question">How are the synths in the technical preview different from previous synth/panorama technology?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <div class="container">
                        The first synth technology, released in 2008, was about combining a completely unstructured set of overlapping photos.
                        Photos used to make a synth could be taken from many different locations and include different zoom levels.
                        The resulting experience was powerful, but the transitions were often jarring—and sometimes downright confusing.<br>
                        In 2010, we added spherical panoramas, one obvious way to constrain the shooting experience and simplify the viewing experience.
                        Spherical panoramas have the property that all photos are (or are assumed to be) shot from exactly the same position in 3D space.
                        The only difference between the photos is where the camera is pointed. This worked well for environments with good lines of sight
                        from a simple place (for example, the middle of a room), but it isn't the right solution for all spaces.<br>
                        Our newest Photosynth technology constrains a set of photos in a different and complementary way.
                        In the new technology, photos are shot so that the result can be viewed by moving along a single understandable path.
                        This experience allows complete predictability of motion and is delightfully touch-friendly.
                        Of course, these intentional constraints are far less general than the original Photosynth,
                        so for now there are still some situations where the original technology is a better solution.
                        These situations primarily involve cases where zooming is absolutely required, such as seeing both the grand sweep of the
                        view from the rim of the Grand Canyon and being able to zoom in on rock formations miles away.

                        The number and size of the photos you are uploading as well as your upload bandwidth to the Internet determines the upload time.
                        You can speed up your upload by using your favorite photo editor to reduce the resolution and/or the JPG compression quality of
                        your photos. However, don't reduce the JPG compression quality below 0.5 or the resolution below 1.5 megapixels.
                        Also, if you've captured a great sequence that you're looking forward to sharing with people, we don't recommend reducing the
                        resolution because doing so prevents viewers from being able to zoom in and see all the interesting details.

                        By default, Photosynth sends out an email notification when a synth has been processed and is ready to view.

                        Yes. If you have real estate, businesses, locations, or products you want to promote, you can create synths using Photosynth and embed
                        the results in your website or blog. Currently, we do not offer an enterprise version of the product, nor do we offer any form of
                        access control. Using Photosynth is a great way to promote a place or product publicly, but not the right choice if you need to
                        closely control who can see your synths.

                                To create a synth that does not display its geographical location, uncheck the
                                "save my synth's location and show it to viewers" in step 4 of the creation process.
                                This checkbox will only be displayed if at least one of the images in your synth contains GPS coordinates.

                                log in to Photosynth and display the synth in your browser.
                                Click on the "synth information" button in the bottom left corner of the screen.
                                Click "edit" below the synth's map.

                                want to reference something else on the Web.

                                Changing the size of the highlight changes its representation on the synth and the thumbnail in the highlight gallery
                                in the bottom right corner of the screen.

                                    <li><em>Show on all frames:</em> Show the highlight on every single frame of the synth.</li>
                                    <li><em>Only show on current frame:</em> Show the highlight only on the frame where you created the highlight.</li>

                                        <em>Manual:</em> Specify the specific range of frames where the highlight is displayed. Move the control's
                                        points to the specific frames where the highlight should start and stop being visible and click "done."
                                        The frame where the highlight was created must be included in the visibility range.

                        There are two ways to hide highlights. First, you can click "hide highlights" above the highlight gallery in the
                        bottom right of the screen. This will both hide the highlight gallery and hide all highlights on the synth. Alternatively,
                        you can click on the "full screen" icon at the bottom of the screen. Highlights are not shown in full screen mode.

                        It may take several minutes (or longer, depending on the length of the synth queue) for your synth to process, so we may not have sent
                        the email notification yet. If it's been quite a while, check your junk email folder to see if the notification was routed to it.
                        (Add ps-norep@email.microsoft.com address to your list of safe senders to prevent your email notifications from being sent to your
