                    With Photosynth, you can capture the places you love in amazing resolution and full 3D.
                The new Photosynth technology previewed here is a dramatic step forward in smoothness and simplicity.
                Experience it yourself in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205005259/https://photosynth.net/preview/">our featured synths</a>.

                <p>
                    This technical preview highlights the third generation of our technology.
                It's what we now recommend for anyone with a D-SLR or a point-and-shoot camera.
                The first two generations of Photosynth technology, original synths and stitched panoramas,
                are still available on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205005259/http://photosynth.net/">our main site</a>.

                <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    When you upload a set of photos to our cloud service, our technology starts by looking for points (called "features")
                in successive photos that appear to be the same object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it finds many features that reoccur in your set of photos, it passes this information on to the second step:
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment" target="_blank">bundle adjustment</a>.
                Bundle adjustment, a standard technique in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry" target="_blank">photogrammetry</a>,
                determines where in 3D space each feature is, exactly where each photo was taken from, and how the camera was oriented for each photo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, the technology uses the feature points in each photo to generate 3D shapes.
                It does so on a per-photo basis rather than trying to generate a global 3D model for the scene.
                The 3D model generated by Photosynth is coarse—you can see it if you type "c" (for camera) in the viewer and then use your mouse wheel
                to zoom out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the technology calculates a smooth path (think of it as a Steadicam) through—or very close to—the camera locations for each photo.
                Using this path, Photosynth presents the experience of moving through a synth as a gliding motion even if the actual photos were shot at different heights or
                slightly off-angle. You can see the path if you type "m" (for map) in the viewer.
                Finally, Photosynth slices and dices the images into multi-resolution pyramids for efficient access.
